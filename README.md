# About this Repository: High School Projects Showcase

Welcome to my **high school projects repository!** This collection features a variety of projects that I worked on during my formative years. While it has been some time since I last revisited these projects, I believe they still serve as a testament to my early passion for programming and the foundations I built during that time.
## Project Highlights

    Language: Mostly Visual Basic, with a transition to Java in my senior year
    Unaltered Projects: These projects remain untouched, providing a valuable snapshot of my growth and progression as a programmer.
    Back-End Code: The complexity and sophistication of the back-end code may vary, with my high school senior year projects exploring fascinating data structures.

## Focus on User Interfaces

While the primary focus of these projects lies in their user interfaces, I encourage you to explore the UI design and implementation, which showcases the skills I acquired through previous classes. These include:

    Programming
    Advanced Programming
    IB Computer Science SL
    Multimedia and Design (featuring Photoshop and design principles)

## Acknowledgments

I hold great appreciation for the classes and teachers that shaped my high school experience, as they played a pivotal role in fostering my passion for programming. Their support and guidance led me to pursue a Computer Science major at George Mason University, where I continue to expand my knowledge and skills.
Thank you for visiting!

Thank you for taking the time to explore my high school projects showcase. I believe it serves as a testament to my early development and provides a glimpse into the trajectory that has brought me to where I am today. If you have any questions or would like to discuss my projects further, please don't hesitate to reach out.
