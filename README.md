# About this Repository: High School Projects Showcase

Welcome to my **high school projects repository!** This collection features a variety of projects that I worked on during my formative years. While it has been some time since I last revisited these projects, I believe they still serve as a testament to my early passion for programming and the foundations I built during that time.
## Project Highlights

    Language: Mostly Visual Basic, with a transition to Java in my senior year
    Unaltered Projects: These projects remain untouched, providing a valuable snapshot of my growth and progression as a programmer.
    Back-End Code: The complexity and sophistication of the back-end code may vary, with my high school senior year projects exploring fascinating data structures.
    
## BraveFrontierTool-IB-CS-SL-Final
The BraveFrontierTool project, the highlight of my senior year in high school as part of my IB Computer Science class. This project holds a significant place in my academic journey, as it challenged me to create a substantial program that adhered to strict IB guidelines. In fact, our teacher emphasized that it would likely surpass the complexity of many university projects.

Designing, implementing, and thoroughly documenting this program was a tremendous learning experience. Despite facing personal circumstances and struggling with Java proficiency at the time, I dedicated myself to mastering new concepts, including creating a GUI from scratch using jFramesâ€”a departure from my previous experience with drag-and-drop components in Visual Studio.

In retrospect, I recognize that the quality of the program may not align with my recent projects' standards. It primarily focused on utilizing data structures, where I now realize that a HashMap could have been a more efficient approach. The core functionality revolved around gathering and parsing user input, as well as designing the GUI. Due to the overwhelming nature of the project and my circumstances, the result resembles more of a prototype than a complete product.

I want to emphasize that the BraveFrontierTool project served as a valuable learning opportunity and a stepping stone in my programming journey. It showcases my determination, adaptability, and eagerness to explore new technologies and concepts. While its complexity may not match my current endeavors, it serves as a reminder of my growth and dedication over time.

To maintain academic integrity and honor the honor code, this project remains within a private repository. For further inquiries about the project, I encourage you to reach out to Garfield High School in VA, my alma mater, and connect with my esteemed teacher, who guided us through this challenging endeavor. They can provide additional insights into the scope, effort, and accomplishments of this project.

Within this repository, you will find the comprehensive materials related to the BraveFrontierTool project, including the cover page and associated files, neatly organized in a dedicated folder of the same name.

It serves as a testament to my perseverance and ability to navigate challenges, even under difficult circumstances. I am excited to apply the valuable lessons I learned from this project to new and more complex endeavors.

## Focus on User Interfaces

While the primary focus of these projects lies in their user interfaces, I encourage you to explore the UI design and implementation, which showcases the skills I acquired through previous classes. These include:

    Programming
    Advanced Programming
    IB Computer Science SL
    Multimedia and Design (featuring Photoshop and design principles)

## Acknowledgments

I am immensely grateful to the classes and teachers who shaped my high school experience, igniting my passion for programming. Their unwavering support led me to pursue a Computer Science major at George Mason University, where I continue to expand my knowledge. I credit my high school CS teacher, Mr. Baker, for helping me overcome imposter syndrome and inspiring my path in Computer Science. His mentorship left a lasting impact on my journey, and I am determined to thrive in this field.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my high school projects showcase. I believe it serves as a testament to my early development and provides a glimpse into the trajectory that has brought me to where I am today. If you have any questions or would like to discuss my projects further, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
